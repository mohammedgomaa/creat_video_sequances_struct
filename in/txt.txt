 'Foundation listening network PANOPTICON is reminded to alert Foundation executive command of the credible appearance of any and all leviathans.'
 "and NTF Sigma-58 “Bottomfeeders” stands ordered to track SCP-4233's trajectory and establish radio contact as often as possible to aid in the discovery of any such sea-going bioforms."
 'Description: SCP-4233 is an amphibious humanoid entity of unknown origin and composition that exhibits potent anomalous properties and operates under an unclear agenda.'
